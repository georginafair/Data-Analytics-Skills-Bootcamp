country = 'United Kingdom'

currency = 'GBP'

#Assignment questions are indicated using Q*)
#Q1) Assign the result of `population` / `area` calculation to a new variable called `density`:
density = population/area
print(density)
#returns 279.9480566609621

#Q2) Select the first 3 characters of the language variable and assign it to a new variable called language_code:
language_code = language[0:3]
print(language_code)
#returns Eng

#Q3) Except for the first character (+ sign), select all other characters from phone_code, and assign the resulting string to a new variable called dial_code:
dial_code = phone_code[1:]
print(dial_code)
#returns 44

#Q5) Assign to a variable called location a string in the format of 'capital, country' e.g. 'Berlin, Germany':
location = f"{capital}, {country}"
location
#returns 'London, United Kingdom'

'''Q6) Your code should work with different inputs of the same type and format:
Update population variable with 68632816
Copy the code from Q1 to the cell below and re-run the code'''
population = 68632816
density = population/area
print(density)
#returns 283.02775727334586
